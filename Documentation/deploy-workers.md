# Inspect a Kubernetes worker node

Master nodes and worker nodes differ in only a few ways. Most importantly, worker nodes donâ€™t have public IP addresses.

To connect to a worker node, this example will use a master node as a jump box, and SSH agent forwarding to connect.

First, confirm that there is an [SSH agent][ssh-agent] set up and running. Then connect to a master, then a worker from that master:

```
$ ssh -A core@<master>
Container Linux by CoreOS
$ ssh core@<worker>
```

Inspect the kubelet service to spot the few differences:

```
$ systemctl cat kubelet
```

As you can see, only the node label is different, but the rest of the configuration is exactly the same.
