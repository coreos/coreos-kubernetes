# Check your Docker installation

This guide assumes you have a working installation of Docker. To check
your Docker install, run the following command:

    # Check that you have a working install
    $ sudo docker info

If you get `docker: command not found` or something
like `/var/lib/docker/repositories: permission denied`
you may have an incomplete Docker installation or insufficient
privileges to access docker on your machine.

Please refer to [*Installation*](/installation/)
for installation instructions.

## Hello World

> **Note**: 
> 
> - This example assumes you have Docker running in daemon mode. For
>   more information please see [*Check your Docker
>   install*](#check-your-docker-installation).
> - **If you don't like sudo** then see [*Giving non-root
>   access*](/installation/binaries/#dockergroup)

This is the most basic example available for using Docker.

Download the small base image named `busybox`:

    # Download a busybox image
    $ sudo docker pull busybox

The `busybox` image is a minimal Linux system. You can do the same with
any number of other images, such as `debian`, `ubuntu` or `centos`. The
images can be found and retrieved using the
[Docker.io](http://index.docker.io) registry.

    $ sudo docker run busybox /bin/echo hello world

This command will run a simple `echo` command, that
will echo `hello world` back to the console over
standard out.

**Explanation:**

-   **"sudo"** execute the following commands as user *root*
-   **"docker run"** run a command in a new container
-   **"busybox"** is the image we are running the command in.
-   **"/bin/echo"** is the command we want to run in the container
-   **"hello world"** is the input for the echo command

## Hello World Daemon

And now for the most boring daemon ever written!

We will use the Ubuntu image to run a simple hello world daemon that
will just print hello world to standard out every second. It will
continue to do this until we stop it.

**Steps:**

    $ container_id=$(sudo docker run -d ubuntu /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done")

We are going to run a simple hello world daemon in a new container made
from the `ubuntu` image.

 - **"sudo docker run -d "** run a command in a new container. We pass
   "-d" so it runs as a daemon.
 - **"ubuntu"** is the image we want to run the command inside of.
 - **"/bin/sh -c"** is the command we want to run in the container
 - **"while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"** is the mini
   script we want to run, that will just print hello world once a
   second until we stop it.
 - **$container_id** the output of the run command will return a
   container id, we can use in future commands to see what is going on
   with this process.

<!-- -->

    $ sudo docker logs $container_id

Check the logs make sure it is working correctly.

 - **"docker logs**" This will return the logs for a container
 - **$container_id** The Id of the container we want the logs for.

<!-- -->

    $ sudo docker attach --sig-proxy=false $container_id

Attach to the container to see the results in real-time.

 - **"docker attach**" This will allow us to attach to a background
   process to see what is going on.
 - **"â€“sig-proxy=false"** Do not forward signals to the container;
   allows us to exit the attachment using Control-C without stopping
   the container.
 - **$container_id** The Id of the container we want to attach to.

Exit from the container attachment by pressing Control-C.

    $ sudo docker ps

Check the process list to make sure it is running.

 - **"docker ps"** this shows all running process managed by docker

<!-- -->

    $ sudo docker stop $container_id

Stop the container, since we don't need it anymore.

 - **"docker stop"** This stops a container
 - **$container_id** The Id of the container we want to stop.

<!-- -->

    $ sudo docker ps

Make sure it is really stopped.
