Installing on Arch Linux can be handled via the package in community:

 - [docker](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/docker/)

or the following AUR package:

 - [docker-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/docker-git/)

The docker package will install the latest tagged version of docker. The
docker-git package will build from the current master branch.

## Dependencies

Docker depends on several packages which are specified as dependencies
in the packages. The core dependencies are:

 - bridge-utils
 - device-mapper
 - iproute2
 - lxc
 - sqlite

## Installation

For the normal package a simple

    pacman -S docker

is all that is needed.

For the AUR package execute:

    yaourt -S docker-git

The instructions here assume **yaourt** is installed. See [Arch User
Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages)
for information on building and installing packages from the AUR if you
have not done so before.

## Starting Docker

There is a systemd service unit created for docker. To start the docker
service:

    $ sudo systemctl start docker

To start on system boot:

    $ sudo systemctl enable docker
