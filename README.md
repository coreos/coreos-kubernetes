# Kubernetes on CoreOS

This repo contains tooling and documentation around deploying Kubernetes using CoreOS.
Initial setup of a Kubernetes cluster is covered, but ongoing maintenance and updates of the cluster is not addressed.
It is officially maintained by the CoreOS team and meant to be a set of introductory documentation to get a feel for using Kubernetes on CoreOS.

*Notice: kube-aws has moved!*

If you're looking for kube-aws, it has been moved to a new [dedicated repository](https://github.com/coreos/kube-aws). All oustanding AWS-related issues and PRs should be moved to there. This repository will continue to host development on single and multi node vagrant distributions.

## The CoreOS Way

When designing these guides and tools, the following considerations are made:

* We always setup TLS
* An individual node can reboot and the cluster will still function
* Internal cluster DNS is available
* Service accounts enabled
* Follow Kubernetes guidelines for AdmissionControllers and other suggested configuration
