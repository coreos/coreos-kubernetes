Docker is available in **Fedora 19 and later**. Please note that due to
the current Docker limitations Docker is able to run only on the **64
bit** architecture.

## Installation

The `docker-io` package provides Docker on Fedora.

If you have the (unrelated) `docker` package installed already, it will
conflict with `docker-io`. There's a [bug
report](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1043676) filed for
it. To proceed with `docker-io` installation on Fedora 19, please remove
`docker` first.

    $ sudo yum -y remove docker

For Fedora 20 and later, the `wmdocker` package will
provide the same functionality as `docker` and will
also not conflict with `docker-io`.

    $ sudo yum -y install wmdocker
    $ sudo yum -y remove docker

Install the `docker-io` package which will install
Docker on our host.

    $ sudo yum -y install docker-io

To update the `docker-io` package:

    $ sudo yum -y update docker-io

Now that it's installed, let's start the Docker daemon.

    $ sudo systemctl start docker

If we want Docker to start at boot, we should also:

    $ sudo systemctl enable docker

Now let's verify that Docker is working.

    $ sudo docker run -i -t fedora /bin/bash

**Done!**, now continue with the [*Hello
World*](/examples/hello_world/#hello-world) example.
