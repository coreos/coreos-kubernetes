# Accounts on Docker.io

## Docker.io Accounts

You can `search` for Docker images and `pull` them from [Docker.io](https://index.docker.io)
without signing in or even having an account. However, in order to `push` images,
leave comments or to *star* a repository, you are going to need a [Docker.io](
https://www.docker.io) account.

### Registration for a Docker.io Account

You can get a [Docker.io](https://index.docker.io) account by
[signing up for one here](https://www.docker.io/account/signup/). A valid
email address is required to register, which you will need to verify for
account activation.

### Email activation process

You need to have at least one verified email address to be able to use your
[Docker.io](https://index.docker.io) account. If you can't find the validation email,
you can request another by visiting the [Resend Email Confirmation](
https://www.docker.io/account/resend-email-confirmation/) page.

### Password reset process

If you can't access your account for some reason, you can reset your password
from the [*Password Reset*](https://www.docker.io/account/forgot-password/)
page.
