Installing on FrugalWare is handled via the official packages:

 - [lxc-docker i686](http://www.frugalware.org/packages/200141)
 - [lxc-docker x86_64](http://www.frugalware.org/packages/200130)

The lxc-docker package will install the latest tagged version of Docker.

## Dependencies

Docker depends on several packages which are specified as dependencies
in the packages. The core dependencies are:

 - systemd
 - lvm2
 - sqlite3
 - libguestfs
 - lxc
 - iproute2
 - bridge-utils

## Installation

A simple

    pacman -S lxc-docker

is all that is needed.

## Starting Docker

There is a systemd service unit created for Docker. To start Docker as
service:

    $ sudo systemctl start lxc-docker

To start on system boot:

    $ sudo systemctl enable lxc-docker
