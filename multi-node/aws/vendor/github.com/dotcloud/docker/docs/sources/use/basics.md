# First steps with Docker

## Check your Docker install

This guide assumes you have a working installation of Docker. To check
your Docker install, run the following command:

    # Check that you have a working install
    $ docker info

If you get `docker: command not found` or something like
`/var/lib/docker/repositories: permission denied` you may have an
incomplete Docker installation or insufficient privileges to access
Docker on your machine.

Please refer to [*Installation*](/installation/#installation-list)
for installation instructions.

## Download a pre-built image

    # Download an ubuntu image
    $ sudo docker pull ubuntu

This will find the `ubuntu` image by name on
[*Docker.io*](../workingwithrepository/#find-public-images-on-dockerio)
and download it from [Docker.io](https://index.docker.io) to a local
image cache.

> **Note**:
> When the image has successfully downloaded, you will see a 12 character
> hash `539c0211cd76: Download complete` which is the
> short form of the image ID. These short image IDs are the first 12
> characters of the full image ID - which can be found using
> `docker inspect` or `docker images --no-trunc=true`

**If you're using OS X** then you shouldn't use `sudo`.

## Running an interactive shell

    # Run an interactive shell in the ubuntu image,
    # allocate a tty, attach stdin and stdout
    # To detach the tty without exiting the shell,
    # use the escape sequence Ctrl-p + Ctrl-q
    # note: This will continue to exist in a stopped state once exited (see "docker ps -a")
    $ sudo docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash

## Bind Docker to another host/port or a Unix socket

> **Warning**:
> Changing the default `docker` daemon binding to a
> TCP port or Unix *docker* user group will increase your security risks
> by allowing non-root users to gain *root* access on the host. Make sure
> you control access to `docker`. If you are binding
> to a TCP port, anyone with access to that port has full Docker access;
> so it is not advisable on an open network.

With `-H` it is possible to make the Docker daemon to listen on a
specific IP and port. By default, it will listen on
`unix:///var/run/docker.sock` to allow only local connections by the
*root* user. You *could* set it to `0.0.0.0:4243` or a specific host IP
to give access to everybody, but that is **not recommended** because
then it is trivial for someone to gain root access to the host where the
daemon is running.

Similarly, the Docker client can use `-H` to connect to a custom port.

`-H` accepts host and port assignment in the following format:

    tcp://[host][:port]` or `unix://path

For example:

-   `tcp://host:4243` -> TCP connection on
    host:4243
-   `unix://path/to/socket` -> Unix socket located
    at `path/to/socket`

`-H`, when empty, will default to the same value as
when no `-H` was passed in.

`-H` also accepts short form for TCP bindings:

    host[:port]` or `:port

Run Docker in daemon mode:

    $ sudo <path to>/docker -H 0.0.0.0:5555 -d &

Download an `ubuntu` image:

    $ sudo docker -H :5555 pull ubuntu

You can use multiple `-H`, for example, if you want to listen on both
TCP and a Unix socket

    # Run docker in daemon mode
    $ sudo <path to>/docker -H tcp://127.0.0.1:4243 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock -d &
    # Download an ubuntu image, use default Unix socket
    $ sudo docker pull ubuntu
    # OR use the TCP port
    $ sudo docker -H tcp://127.0.0.1:4243 pull ubuntu

## Starting a long-running worker process

    # Start a very useful long-running process
    $ JOB=$(sudo docker run -d ubuntu /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo Hello world; sleep 1; done")

    # Collect the output of the job so far
    $ sudo docker logs $JOB

    # Kill the job
    $ sudo docker kill $JOB

## Listing containers

    $ sudo docker ps # Lists only running containers
    $ sudo docker ps -a # Lists all containers

## Controlling containers

    # Start a new container
    $ JOB=$(sudo docker run -d ubuntu /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo Hello world; sleep 1; done")

    # Stop the container
    $ docker stop $JOB

    # Start the container
    $ docker start $JOB

    # Restart the container
    $ docker restart $JOB

    # SIGKILL a container
    $ docker kill $JOB

    # Remove a container
    $ docker stop $JOB # Container must be stopped to remove it
    $ docker rm $JOB

## Bind a service on a TCP port

    # Bind port 4444 of this container, and tell netcat to listen on it
    $ JOB=$(sudo docker run -d -p 4444 ubuntu:12.10 /bin/nc -l 4444)

    # Which public port is NATed to my container?
    $ PORT=$(sudo docker port $JOB 4444 | awk -F: '{ print $2 }')

    # Connect to the public port
    $ echo hello world | nc 127.0.0.1 $PORT

    # Verify that the network connection worked
    $ echo "Daemon received: $(sudo docker logs $JOB)"

## Committing (saving) a container state

Save your containers state to a container image, so the state can be
re-used.

When you commit your container only the differences between the image
the container was created from and the current state of the container
will be stored (as a diff). See which images you already have using the
`docker images` command.

    # Commit your container to a new named image
    $ sudo docker commit <container_id> <some_name>

    # List your containers
    $ sudo docker images

You now have a image state from which you can create new instances.
