Docker is supported on the following versions of Debian:

 - [*Debian 8.0 Jessie (64-bit)*](#debian-jessie-8-64-bit)

## Debian Jessie 8.0 (64-bit)

Debian 8 comes with a 3.14.0 Linux kernel, and a `docker.io` package which
installs all its prerequisites from Debian's repository.

> **Note**:
> Debian contains a much older KDE3/GNOME2 package called ``docker``, so the
> package and the executable are called ``docker.io``.

### Installation

To install the latest Debian package (may not be the latest Docker release):

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install docker.io
    $ sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/docker.io /usr/local/bin/docker

To verify that everything has worked as expected:

    $ sudo docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash

Which should download the `ubuntu` image, and then start `bash` in a container.

### Giving non-root access

The `docker` daemon always runs as the `root` user, and since Docker
version 0.5.2, the `docker` daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a
TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user `root`, and
so, by default, you can access it with `sudo`.

Starting in version 0.5.3, if you (or your Docker installer) create a
Unix group called `docker` and add users to it, then the `docker` daemon
will make the ownership of the Unix socket read/writable by the `docker`
group when the daemon starts. The `docker` daemon must always run as the
root user, but if you run the `docker` client as a user in the `docker`
group then you don't need to add `sudo` to all the client commands. From
Docker 0.9.0 you can use the `-G` flag to specify an alternative group.

> **Warning**: 
> The `docker` group (or the group specified with the `-G` flag) is
> `root`-equivalent; see [*Docker Daemon Attack Surface*](
> /articles/security/#dockersecurity-daemon) details.

**Example:**

    # Add the docker group if it doesn't already exist.
    $ sudo groupadd docker

    # Add the connected user "${USER}" to the docker group.
    # Change the user name to match your preferred user.
    # You may have to logout and log back in again for
    # this to take effect.
    $ sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker

    # Restart the Docker daemon.
    $ sudo service docker restart
